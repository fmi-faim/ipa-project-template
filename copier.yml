_message_before_copy: |
    Thank you for using our ipa-project template to get your image processing
    and analysis project started. We will ask you a few questions to tailor the
    project to your needs.

    Before you start, please make sure you have git installed on your system.
    You can type `git --version` in your terminal to check if it is installed.

    Your project "{{ project_name }}" has been created successfully!

    Next steps:

    1. Change directory to the project root:

       $ cd {{ _copier_conf.dst_path }}

    2. Initialize a new git repository either via GitHub Desktop App or
         via the command line:

       $ git init
       $ git add .
       $ git commit -m "Initial commit."
       $ git branch -M main

    3. Build the project documentation:

       $ pixi run build_docs
